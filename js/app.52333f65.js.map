class=\"margin-bottom-30\">The FindCandidate story begins over a decade ago, when the tech lead of a Silicon Valley startup realized his close friend in Athens would be perfect for a web project. The team agreed he was the best choice, but were concerned about working with someone halfway around the globe. </p>\r\n                <h4 class=\"margin-bottom-30\">A new way of working is born</h4>\r\n                <p class=\"margin-bottom-30\"> In response, the two friends created a new web-based platform that brought visibility and trust to remote work. It was so successful the two realized other businesses would also benefit from reliable access to a larger pool of quality talent, while workers would enjoy freedom and flexibility to find jobs online. Together they decided to start a company that would deliver on the promise of this technology.\r\n                Fast-forward to today, that technology is the foundation of FindCandidate — the largest global freelancing website. With millions of jobs posted on FindCandidate annually, freelancers are earning money by providing companies with over 5,000 skills across more than 70 categories of work. </p>\r\n                <h4 class=\"margin-bottom-30\">A world of opportunities</h4>\r\n                <p class=\"margin-bottom-30\"> Through FindCandidate businesses get more done, connecting with freelancers to work on projects from web and mobile app development to SEO, social media marketing, content writing, graphic design, admin help and thousands of other projects.
